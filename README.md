# RL-in-Cartpole

### **An implementation of RL concepts in Cartpole game**

This project aims to be an example of the implementation of various reinforcement learning concepts using the Gym library in Python.


---
**It specifically**

**Phase 1**: Focuses on the **`CartPole`** environment provided by `Gym`.

**Phase 2**: Takes a look at some algorithms like `QLearning` and `SARSA`.

**Phase 3**: Provides a custom env named `CustomMiniGridEnv` instead of using `Gym` environments and applies `Tabular QLearning` on it.

**Phase 4**: Makes itself better and better in deeper insights
